    The design industry is constantly evolving. This means that new design trends are always arising and it's important for designers to be able to adapt to these changes. While functionality is most important, beautiful design should not be disregarded either. Considering we were meant to only focus on visual design, processes such as exploring user flows and doing extensive user research were omitted. These concepts were meant to demonstrate my skills as related to aesthetics and elegant design. To execute the design of this app, I used Illustrator. I had to focus a lot on typography, visual hierarchy, and overall format so that UX was still being considered as well.
