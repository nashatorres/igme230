        <p class = "para">
            Hi! I'm Nasha and I'm a New Media Design student at Rochester Institute of Technology. Before I switched into New Media, I was actually a Biology major planning on heading to medical schoolâ€“ little did I know, design would become my life. My passion to help the people around me has fostered my ability to emphasize, which is a huge factor I have carried from my experience studying Biology and always emphasize as a UX designer now.</p>
        <p class = "para">I think it's crucial for designers to create meaningful experiences that reach a wide variety of audiences. Whether this is achieved through interaction, product, visual design, or others, we ultimately help make our surroundings a lot more inclusive. You can find me spending thousands of hours in the lab sipping on vanilla lattes or iced tea. When I'm not designing, I'm most likely hanging out with friends at our radio station, watching way too many episodes of Parks and Recreation, burning food, or catching up on sleep! </p>
