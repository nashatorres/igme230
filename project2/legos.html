   <h2 class = "projHead">3D Lego Render</h2>
   <p class = "projP">
    One of my favorite parts about being in New Media Design is the fact that we learn so many different skills. One of my favorite things to work on was this 3D Lego render. In order to accomplish this, I used Cinema 4D and edited it a bit on photoshop for small adjustments such as lighting and color values. This process took a very long time considering the legos were extremely difficult to model. The most difficult part would be the bottom where the 3 holes are. I had to account for the middle hole which is attached to a straight line that splits down the lego itself. Other than that, the plate was super easy.
